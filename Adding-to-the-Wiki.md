Editing the NaviGator Wiki
=====================

Any team member can edit the wiki at any time. The contribution rules are much more lax than that of the regular NaviGator repository, but there are still a few requirements.

* Use proper English spelling
* Use proper formatting to make an easily readable page (Section headers, links, etc)

When it comes to the wiki no amount of information is too much information, so long as the important parts of your article are easy to identify.

# Adding a page
A new page will not immediately appear in the sidebar, you will have to manually add it to the custom sidebar we use. Put it in the appropriate section, or create a new one if necessary.
