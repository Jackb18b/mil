Getting Started Guide
=====================

1. Clone this repository. As of now, Sub8 has no dependencies on the rest of uf-mil, so it can exist in its own catkin workspace.

2. Read the code policy page on this wiki. 

3. Get to know the people on the team


Check out a few libraries:
[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/), [PCL](pointclouds.org), [OMPL](http://ompl.kavrakilab.org/)

And a few courses:
[Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra), [Intro to Algorithms](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/), [Underactuated Robotics](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-832-underactuated-robotics-spring-2009/)

There is another Underactuated robotics course taught by the same guy on Edx. The Edx course is much better.
