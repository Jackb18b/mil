Notes for Pool Days
===================

# Lessons Learned
* Checklist

    * Batteries Charged?

    * Everything assembled? Screws missing?

* Always meet in MIL beforehand, we may spend as much as an hour of unexpected time prepping the sub


# Notes

* We will generally not have internet access

* Make sure *everything* you need is already installed on the sub, and that you have already tried running it, on the vehicle, in the lab


# Spells

* Copy things to the sub...

    scp /some/local/directory forrest@Subjugator:~/sub8_ws/src/Sub8

* Add a git remote for the usb

    git remote add sub ssh://forrest@subjugator/home/forrest/sub8_ws/src/Sub8


# TODO
* Get outdoor speakers, we need pool-day music
