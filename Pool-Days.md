Notes for Pool Days
===================

# Lessons Learned
* Checklist

    * Batteries Charged?

    * Everything assembled? Screws missing?

* Always meet in MIL beforehand, we may spend as much as an hour of unexpected time prepping the sub


# Notes

* We will generally not have internet access

* Make sure *everything* you need is already installed on the sub, and that you have already tried running it, on the vehicle, in the lab


# Spells

* Copy things to the sub...

    scp /some/local/directory sub8@mil-sub-sub8.ad.mil.ufl.edu:~/mil_ws/src/SubjuGator

* Add a git remote for the usb

    git remote add sub ssh://sub8@mil-sub-sub8.ad.mil.ufl.edu/home/sub8/mil_ws/src/SubjuGator


# TODO
* Get outdoor speakers, we need pool-day music
