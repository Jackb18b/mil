# Terminology #

* **Point**: 
    1. In the **body coordinate frame**, a **point** is a 6D vector describing the sway, surge, heave, roll, pitch, and yaw of the vehicle at an instance in time
    1. In the **world coordinate frame**, a **point** is a 6D vector describing the x, y, and z (depth) positions and the angular velocities about each axis of the vehicle at an instance in time
* **Waypoint**: A desired position (location and orientation) and desired velocity (linear and angular) within the world reference frame
* **Free space**: A sub-region within the visible, traversable region near the vehicle that is believed to be unobstructed 
* **RRT**: Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees - [Seminal paper on RRTs](http://webpages.uncc.edu/xiao/itcs6151-8151/RRT.pdf)

# Requirements #

The Trajectory Generator should...

1. Know the starting point in world coordinates for a trajectory that needs to be calculated
2. Know the target waypoint for a trajectory
3. Know the desired speed for the trajectory, whether given or pre-defined 
4. Know the vehicle-specific kinematics and dynamics to parameterize the motion-planner (MP) with 
5. Have the most-recently available traversability map and should know the location of all obstacles on the map
6. Contain a motion-planner (MP) module that has multiple, swappable planning algorithms
7. Contain a module that is responsible for smoothing the path produced by the MP (Ensuring C3 continuity) 
8. Contain a module that encapsulates the construction and storage of "safety" back-up paths in free space generated and updated by the MP
9. Generate a list of waypoints that make up the resultant trajectory; the trajectory should be C3 continuous and obey vehicle-specific kinodynamics
10. Provide nodes subscribed to the T-generator with the next viable waypoint in a "timely manner" (_Need to define the rate at which waypoints are served_)
11. Be able to receive an updated traversability map with new obstacles, and assess whether a portion of
the list of future waypoints will collide with the new obstacles
12. Be able to handle planning and re-planning failures by switching to a safety path or requesting a system shutdown when appropriate

# System Details #

## Configuration ##
* Any kinematic/dynamic constraints that can be provided ahead-of-time to the T-generator
* TBD

## Data input  ##
* Starting point 
* Variable vehicle-specific limitations on the trajectory generation (TBD)

## Data output
* Next waypoint

## Alarms

> _Alarm description (severity level): response_

1. Entered unavoidable collision zone (0): abort mission
1. No usable safety paths (1): abort mission
1. Planning failed (2): try to use a safety path
1. Re-plan failure (2): try to use a safety path 

## Modules ##
1. **Motion-Planner**
    1. Can contain a variable number of path-planning algorithms
    1. Autonomously engages a path-planning algorithm to generate a trajectory
    1. Encapsulates the implementation details of the path-planning algorithms - other modules should not know whether the trajectory is computed by GPU or CPU, etc
    1. Should be customized for each vehicle it is used for, since certain steps within different path-planning algorithms require knowledge of problem-specific kinodynamics. Use Template Method or Dependency Injection
1. **Fast Smoother**
    1. Takes in a path (list of waypoints) generated by the motion-planner and applies (a) smoothing algorithm(s) to create a feasible trajectory
    1. May contain more than one smoothing algorithm - current plan is to use B-splines
    1. Outputs the smoothed trajectory (list of waypoints)
1. **Safety-Path Coordinator**
    1. Safety paths are trajectories that will keep the vehicle in free space 
    1. SPC is responsible for maintaining and updating a library of back-up paths that can be taken if the live trajectory becomes infeasible unexpectedly
    1. After the target trajectory is generated and the motion-planner is no longer engaged with carrying out that task, instead of having it sit idle, that module should begin generating and updating safety paths 
    1. It is advisable to maintain at least (2) viable "safety" paths, if possible.
1. Re-Planner
1. Message-Handler
1. T-Generator Mediator
