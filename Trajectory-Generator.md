## Trajectory Generator ##

### Terminology ###

1. **Point**: 6D vector containing the sway, surge, heave, roll, pitch, and yaw of the vehicle at a point in time
1. **Waypoint**: A desired position (location and orientation) along with the desired velocity (linear and angular) within the world reference frame
1. **Free space**: A sub-region within the visible, traversable region near the vehicle that is believed to be unobstructed 
1. **RRT**: Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees 

### Trajectory Generator Requirements ###

The Trajectory Generator should...

1. Know the starting point for a target trajectory
2. Know the desired end point for a target trajectory
3. Know the desired average velocity for the path to be planned, or use a pre-defined value 
4. Know the vehicle-specific kinodynamics to parameterize the MP with 
5. Know the current traversability map and the location of all obstacles within that map
6. Contain a motion-planner (MP) sub-module that contains implementations of interchangeable planning algorithms such as RRT*, A*, etc. For the MVP, at least one planner (RRT*) will suffice
7. Contain a sub-module that is responsible for smoothing the path produced by the MP (Spline T-generator)
8. Maintain a library of "safety" paths generated by the MP in free space
9. Produce a list of waypoints for a target trajectory subject to the vehicle-specific kinodynamics
10. Provide interested system components with the next viable waypoint in a "timely manner" (Need to define the update rate)
11. Be able to receive an updated traversability map with new obstacles, and access whether a portion of
the list of future waypoints will collide with the new obstacles
12. Be able to recognize when re-planning is needed based on the new map 
13. Be able to handle planning and re-planning failures by switching to a safety path or requesting a system shutdown when appropriate
