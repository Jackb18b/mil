# Requirements #

The Trajectory Generator should...

1. Know the start state of a desired trajectory
2. Know the goal state for a trajectory
3. Know the vehicle-specific dynamics
4. Have access to the most-recently available traversability map
5. Know the location of all obstacles in its environment
6. Be able to determine the planner being used at run-time
7. Contain a module that encapsulates the construction and storage of "safety" paths in free space 
8. Be able to determine whether an updated traversability map invalidates 
9. Make available a list of waypoints that make up the solution to the planning problem
10. Be able to handle planning and re-planning failures by switching to a safety path or requesting a system shutdown

## Alarms

> _Alarm description (severity level): response_

1. Entered unavoidable collision zone (0): abort mission
1. No usable safety paths (1): abort mission
1. Planning failed (2): try to use a safety path
1. Re-plan failure (2): try to use a safety path 

## Components ##
1. **Motion-Planner**
    1. Implementation of OMPL for AUVs
    1. Main task is to use one of OMPL's path-planning algorithm to generate a trajectory
    1. LQR-RRT* is being considered, which uses LQR as a distance function and node extension heuristic in RRT* for increased performance
1. **Fast-Smoother** (Not sure if this will be necessary yet)
    1. Takes in a path (list of waypoints) generated by the motion-planner and applies (a) smoothing algorithm(s) to create a feasible trajectory
    1. May contain more than one smoothing algorithm 
    1. Outputs the smoothed trajectory (list of waypoints)
1. **Safety-Path Coordinator**
    1. Safety paths are trajectories that will keep the vehicle in free space 
    1. SPC is responsible for maintaining and updating a library of back-up paths that can be taken if the live trajectory becomes infeasible unexpectedly
    1. After the target trajectory is generated and the motion-planner is no longer engaged with carrying out that task, instead of having it sit idle, that module should begin generating and updating safety paths 
    1. It is advisable to maintain at least (2) viable "safety" paths, if possible.
    1. SPC should provide options for returning the "best" safety-path: the path that keeps the vehicle farthest from any obstacles, the path that will get the vehicle to a safe location in the shortest time, the path that expends the least amount of energy, etc. **This probably isn't necessary for the MVP**
1. **Re-Planner**
    1. An algorithm that uses as a metric the ratio of obstructed to unobstructed waypoints will determine how much of the current trajectory needs to be re-planned. This way, time is not wasted re-planning the entire trajectory for a small obstacle, but if a large obstacle is obstructing the majority of the trajectory, a new trajectory will be generated
    1. Stretch goal is to do partial-trajectory re-planning. For starters, just replan starting from the affected waypoint
    1. If re-planning fails, the SPC should be notified to provide a safety path 
1. **TGEN Node**
    1. Encapsulates all topic/service/action logic and callbacks 
    1. Should be loosely coupled from all other modules - only needs to know the T-Generator Mediator, who will handle delegating tasks to the other modules
1. **TGEN Manager**
    1. Encapsulates all communication between T-Generator modules to promote loose-coupling
    1. Facade for the OMPL-implementation
