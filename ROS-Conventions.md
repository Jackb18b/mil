ROS Conventions
================

Packages should be prepended with sub8_*. 
Ex:

`sub8_thruster_driver`

`sub8_control`

And so on.

This is intended to guarantee that there will be no name conflicts with existing packages, or other packages with similar names. I.e., to create a "sub8" ROS namespace.
