## Python Style Guide
Welcome to the Python style guide for MIL. This guide is meant to be a relaxed, easy-to-follow guide with some tips on how to make your Python look snazzy! It's based on the [ROS style guide](http://wiki.ros.org/PyStyleGuide) and the [Google Python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

Don't feel pressured to know or understand every rule, and totally feel free to skim over the guide at first. This guide can provide some helpful information before you begin to write your Python, but it also serves as an excellent place to determine how to use a particular Python feature in your code.

Additionally, this guide is not meant to be permanent! If you have a suggestion, feel free to bring it up and change the guide! Have fun!
