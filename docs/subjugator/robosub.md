# RoboSub competition

## Overview
The fundamental goal of the RoboSub competition is for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle 
(AUV) to demonstrate its autonomy by completing underwater tasks, with a new theme each year.
The theme does not usually impact what the tasks themselves. There are usually tasks that 
involve passing thorugh a gate, recognizing images and shooting torpedoes at targets, 
recognizing downfacing objects and dropping a marker, listening and localizing sound pingers
and navigate towards them, and surface in a specified area. 

## Recommendations before
- TEST BEFORE, A LOT. At least a semester prior to the summer of the competition, a testing
 schedule needs to be designed which involves pretty much testing biweekly in spring and weekly
 during the summer. Test first single tasks in the smaller and more accesible pools but also,
 test in a full course at least at a big pool such as Florida pool as much as possible when the 
 single tasks have been mastered. As soon as you arrive to the competition, dedicate the first 
 few tests to check the behavior of the sub in tasks that might have changed between Gainesville 
 and the new pool. 

- Pack a replacement for everything in the sub - The proces of packing should not be done in a rush. 
On it, we should think about what could break in the sub, and bring a replacement for basically every 
part of the sub.

- Pack or come up with a method to transport the sub from the tent where the team normally is to the 
competition pool
 

 ## Recommendations during
- Designate a person that signs up for testing slots - Normally, everyday of the competition
really early in the morning (6 am), the slots to test are assigned randomly if a person of the team
is present. Therefore a system to have a responsible single person or a rotation of people per day is 
recommended to ensure we always get an early slot.

- H:wqave a list of equipment needed for any testing and pool run. 
The lists _must_ include only things that are brought with us to all testing, and 
it _must_ include all of the things that need need to be checked at before a run such as 
proper connection of cables. A useful rule of thumb is to always be ready 10 min before a run. 

- Rest responsibly - lack of sleep can cause the team to make mistakes we may
not have made had we heen more well-rested.

- Interacted with other teams - learn from the other teams at the event and try to make friends with
them. It is cool to talk to people trying to solve the same problems you are solving.
