# Age of Heroes

(Bagnell, Burnette, Devin)

# Schism, or the Age of Strife (~2013-2014)

There was a major schism, in which many people left the lab, as a result of a disagreement about how Propagator 2 should be designed. The core of the disagreement was whether to favor the graduate or the undergraduate students. At the end of this, there were just a handful of people remaining in the lab. By fall of 2014, there were really just three people actively working on MIL software.
