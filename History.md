This is non-sidebar page that briefly elucidates the recent history of MIL. Work in progress. Please add information if you have any.

# Age of Heroes (1999-2006?)

(Drew Bagnell, Don Burnette, Devin Hughes)

The dawn of MIL, great early subs were built, it would be nearly a decade until ROS entered the fray. Everything was much harder, Python was impractical.

# Age of "Nobody knows"

(That guy from Harris)

The title is pretty clear on this one.

# Schism, or the Age of Strife (~2013-2014)

(Forrest Voight, Matt Thompson)

There was a major schism, in which many people left the lab, as a result of a disagreement about how Propagator 2 should be designed. The core of the disagreement was whether to favor the graduate or the undergraduate students. At the end of this, there were just a handful of people remaining in the lab. By fall of 2014, there were really just three people actively working on MIL software.

# Reawakening (IEEE 2015)
* MIL was in a state of stupor, few people were left
* Sought out 40 person team, with the intention of making all of them productive team members
* Inspired by Mason Turner's example for IEEE2014 (A team of only 5 people), moved the hardware team from being a side-project for new members to a major project, with many people.

# The Dawn of a new era (2014 - 2016)
* Doing motion planning for the first time
* Every team in the lab is stacked with skilled people
* We have alumni all over the country in many of the most prominent robotics groups in the world
* Graphics card computing!
