Manifesto
=========

This is the mantra of the Sub software team.


* Don't be stubborn, but *do* be very skeptical

* Do not fear complexity

    * But at the same time, don't introduce complexity for no reason

* Sense of humor is required

* Impatience is unacceptable

* Uncommented code is garbage code

* Meetings should happen as infrequently as possible

* No bullshit tasks for new people

* Work done for free is always open source. No exceptions.

* You shouldn't be restricted to working on things that you understand, but you should *absolutely* understand once you're done working on it

# Can I work on the sub?

## Yes, if you satisfy any or all of the following
    * I am a very dedicated learner
    * I have a background in robotics
    * I already know Python and am learning ROS

If you don't, you may be better suited to working on the IEEE hardware team until their competition.
