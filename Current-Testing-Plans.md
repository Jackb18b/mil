# **Current Testing Plans**

## These are things we want to get done before the next testing day at the lake
### The next testing day is _possibly_ Tuesday May 24th. Subject to change.
* Observe buoys with LIDAR in buoy field (~15 buoys >8 ft apart)
* Prove that controller/path planner works by repeatably driving boat to and from fixed objects (buoys)
* Have a new student operate the boat after reading wiki
* Add the ability to click a path into RVIZ - TODO
* Test new trolling motor mounts
* Reach goal pending construction, observe docking signs with cameras (need to remount cameras)

### Things tested at last testing day, April 23rd
* Create a permanent version of move helper that is controlled from the GUI
* Rethink the flow of data to set a waypoint as well as come up with logical and distinct topic names - **We will discuss this at the meeting**
* Create a networking script that will set up someone's computer completely to work with the boat - ZACH
* Create a docking mode allowing for a front thruster only kill
* Add state estimation on computer startup
* Test Trajectory Generator (Forrest)

### Things tested at last testing day, April 1st
* Fix coordinates system irregularities
* Set software thrust limits to 600
* Create RQT GUI to allow for RC-less control
* Finalize message arbitrating system
* Test Adaptive portion of adaptive controller (Jason)
* Tested boat in 15 kts of wind
