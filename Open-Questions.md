Open Questions, Sub8
====================

Does the DVL need to be operated in bottom-tracking mode? How much are we at the mercy of currents? Do we actually see substantial current in the TRANSDEC? Could we offset it with optical flow?

When are we getting the new Nav Board (Matt says Oct 25th)? He's writing new sensor interface code - is this going to be as easy as he believes? Right now, there is a gumstix in the nav-box doing the sensor interfacing.
