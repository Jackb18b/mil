This is an unlisted wiki page that Jake uses to track his little projects. Uh-oh, how did you find it!?


In order...

- [ ] V & V node for controllers with pyplot 3d visualization
    - [ ] Randomized orientation
    - [ ] Visualize orientation progress
    - [ ] Visualize velocity vectors
    - [ ] Actual quality assessment
        - [ ] Rise/settling time is pretty meaningless
        - [ ] Optimization is the only way
    - [x] Visualize many trajectories
- [x] Get sim to run faster than real-time
- [ ] Submit a pull-request for the 3D Mouse
- [ ] Add headless simulation so we can run on Semaphore
    - [ ] OR! Figure out how to run vispy headless on Semaphore
- [ ] Add integration tests for the PD Controller
- [ ] Submit a pull-request for the controller

- [ ] Focus on vision (Implement visul odometry in some meaningful way - we need non-shitty cameras)
- [ ] Make everything work on simulated time so we can run Monte-Carlos in faster than realtime

Random:
    - [ ] Make increment-numbers again
    - [ ] Some reflection tool for automatically making *stamped messages
